Last Mile Delivery Analysis:

Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the delivery performance of a pizza franchise, specifically examining key metrics related to delivery time and customer satisfaction. The objective is to identify areas for improvement to ensure timely deliveries, minimize revenue loss due to late deliveries, and enhance overall store performance.

Problem Statement:
The owner of a pizza store is concerned about maintaining key performance metrics—delivery time and customer satisfaction. Company's policy mandates that all orders be delivered within 30 minutes; otherwise, the pizza is free for the customer. The owner seeks a data-driven approach to evaluate the store's performance and implement strategies to improve efficiency, especially as an audit is scheduled.

Analysis Goals:
Delivery Time Analysis: Determine the average and 99th percentile delivery times to assess performance against the 30-minute delivery guarantee.
Order Analysis: Identify the number of pizzas ordered and those delivered late (beyond 30 minutes) within a specified period.
Revenue Impact: Calculate the total revenue lost due to late deliveries and identify the year with the maximum loss due to refunds.
Capacity Planning: Provide insights to optimize the delivery fleet's capacity to improve on-time deliveries and customer satisfaction.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization to help in understanding trends and patterns.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for interactive data exploration and analysis.

Data:
The dataset includes historical data related to order placements, delivery times, and other relevant variables. Due to confidentiality constraints, the data cannot be shared or made publicly available.

Key Insights:
Average Delivery Time: The average delivery time was calculated to assess the store’s general performance.
99th Percentile Delivery Time: This metric was used to understand the extreme cases of late deliveries.
Revenue Loss: Significant revenue was lost due to orders delivered beyond the 30-minute mark.
Capacity Planning Recommendations: Based on the analysis, recommendations were provided to optimize the delivery fleet's capacity.
